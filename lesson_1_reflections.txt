How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

By using the diff function, I made the computer find out all of the mistakes
and differences between both of the files for me, meaning that I would not
miss any mistakes and I would not have to go through all of the hundreds of
lines of code to look for the mistakes.
